## Project Architecture

### Core Structure
This is a single-page web application built as a TR-808 drum machine with AI pattern generation. The main application file is `tr808-mvp.html` which contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file for simplicity.

### Technology Stack
- **Audio Engine**: Tone.js v14.8.49 for Web Audio API abstraction
- **AI Integration**: Claude API for pattern generation
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (single-file approach)
- **Styling**: CSS3 with custom properties for theming
- **Development**: live-server for local development

### Key Components (within tr808-mvp.html)
1. **Drum Engine**: Manages 8 drum tracks with velocity and accent control
2. **Sequencer**: 16-step pattern sequencer with visual feedback
3. **AI Pattern Generator**: Natural language pattern generation via Claude API
4. **Preset System**: 8 built-in genre presets (Classic 808, Trap, Techno, etc.)
5. **Transport Controls**: Play/stop, tempo control, tap tempo
6. **Per-track Controls**: Volume, mute, solo for each drum sound

### Audio Architecture
The application uses synthetic drum sounds generated with Tone.js oscillators and filters rather than samples. Each drum sound is carefully crafted to emulate classic TR-808 characteristics:
- Kick: Sub-bass oscillator with pitch envelope
- Snare: Noise generator with bandpass filtering
- Hi-hats: High-frequency noise with quick decay
- Clap: Multiple noise bursts with reverb

### State Management
All application state is managed in vanilla JavaScript with global objects:
- `patterns`: Current step patterns for all tracks
- `accents`: Accent patterns for velocity control
- `trackStates`: Mute/solo states per track
- `tempoManager`: BPM and timing control

### Development Notes

#### Current Architecture Constraints
- **Single-file approach**: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in `tr808-mvp.html` for simplicity
- **No build process**: Direct development without transpilation or bundling
- **CDN dependencies**: Tone.js loaded from external CDN, no local package management
- **Synthetic audio**: Uses Tone.js oscillators/filters instead of audio samples
- **Local-only storage**: Patterns saved to browser localStorage, no cloud sync yet

#### Code Organization (within tr808-mvp.html)
- **CSS Variables**: Extensive use of CSS custom properties for theming (lines ~10-26)
- **Modular JS**: Functional approach with clear separation of concerns:
  - Audio engine initialization and drum sound definitions
  - Pattern management and step sequencer logic
  - UI event handlers and visual feedback
  - AI integration for pattern generation
  - Transport controls and tempo management

#### Key Development Patterns
- **Event-driven architecture**: Heavy use of event listeners for UI interactions
- **State management**: Global objects for patterns, accents, trackStates
- **Audio scheduling**: Tone.js Transport for precise timing and scheduling
- **Responsive design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for drum machine layout
- **Local persistence**: JSON serialization to localStorage for pattern saving

#### Testing Considerations
- Audio testing requires user interaction (browser autoplay policies)
- Visual feedback testing needs timing validation
- Pattern generation requires API key for Claude integration
- Cross-browser audio compatibility (Web Audio API support)

### Future Architecture & Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Enhancements (Next 2-4 weeks)
- **Sample-based audio**: Replace synthetic sounds with authentic TR-808 samples
- **Multiple drum kits**: 808, 909, 707, LinnDrum sample sets
