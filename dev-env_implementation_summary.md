# DevOps Project Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Set up automated DevOps infrastructure across three hosts with CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and secrets management.

**Architecture**: Three-tier setup with mesh networking
- OSIRIS (Windows 11): Control plane and orchestration
- DEV-GPU (Ubuntu): Staging environment and CI/CD runner  
- VPS (Hostinger): Production deployment target

## Major Technology Decisions

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform**: Chosen over Pulumi for infrastructure provisioning
- **Ansible**: Selected over shell scripts for configuration management
- **GitHub Actions**: Preferred over Drone/Woodpecker for CI/CD pipeline

### Networking and Security
- **Tailscale**: Mesh VPN connecting all three hosts
- **SSH key-based authentication**: Passwordless access between hosts
- **1Password CLI**: Secrets management (trial account created during setup)

### Container and Monitoring Stack
- **Docker**: Container runtime on all Linux hosts
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**: Image storage and distribution
- **Grafana Cloud**: Monitoring solution (free tier only, zero budget constraint)

### Development Environment
- **WSL2 Ubuntu**: Primary orchestration environment on Windows 11
- **Python virtual environments**: Isolated tooling for Ansible/Terraform
- **SSH-based remote access**: Direct terminal access to all hosts

## Implementation Phases

### Phase A: Design and Planning
- Risk assessment and technology comparison completed
- Pre-flight checklist validation
- Architecture decisions documented
- All automation files created but not executed

### Phase B: Infrastructure Setup
- WSL2 bootstrap environment creation
- Network connectivity establishment
- Remote host configuration via Ansible
- CI/CD pipeline preparation

## Critical Technical Challenges and Solutions

### WSL2 Detection Issue
**Problem**: Bootstrap script failed with case-sensitive Microsoft detection
**Root Cause**: Script checked for "Microsoft" but system showed "microsoft"
**Solution**: Modified detection to use case-insensitive grep (-i flag)

### SSH Access Configuration
**Problem**: Ansible playbooks initially failed due to root access assumptions
**Root Cause**: DEV-GPU configured with regular user (cdc) not root access
**Solution**: Updated inventory to use correct user accounts per host

### Docker Repository Conflicts
**Problem**: VPS had conflicting Docker repository configurations
**Root Cause**: Previous Docker installation attempts left conflicting apt sources
**Solution**: Manual cleanup of repository files before re-running Ansible

### Secrets Management Budget Constraint
**Problem**: Initially planned 1Password CLI with zero budget
**Root Cause**: 1Password requires paid subscription
**Solution**: Created trial account, planned future migration to SOPS+Age if needed

## Network Configuration Details

### Tailscale Mesh Network
- OSIRIS: 100.80.43.125 (Windows 11 control plane)
- DEV-GPU: 100.106.201.33 (Ubuntu staging, previously cdc-sd)
- VPS: 100.96.28.69 (Production target, srv880446)

### SSH Key Management
- Keys generated on OSIRIS WSL2 environment
- Public keys distributed to both remote hosts
- Passwordless authentication verified for automation

## User Account Strategy
- **OSIRIS**: cdc user in WSL2 Ubuntu environment
- **DEV-GPU**: cdc user with sudo privileges (not root)
- **VPS**: root user access (standard VPS configuration)

## Budget and Resource Constraints

### Cost Optimization Decisions
- Grafana Cloud: Free tier only, no paid monitoring
- 1Password: Trial account, consider SOPS+Age migration
- VPS: Hostinger KVM 2 plan (8GB RAM, 100GB SSD)
- Total monthly cost target: Under $10 excluding VPS hosting

### Performance Considerations
- GPU CI tests: Manual trigger only, not automatic on every push
- Resource allocation: DEV-GPU handles heavy compute, VPS for lightweight production
- Backup strategy: Future NAS integration planned

## Critical File Structure
```
D:\DevOps-Project\
├── infra/ (Terraform configurations)
├── ansible/ (Playbooks and inventory)
├── scripts/ (Bootstrap automation)
├── .github/workflows/ (CI/CD pipeline)
└── docs/ (Project documentation)
```

## Lessons Learned

### Environment Complexity
- WSL2 networking requires understanding Windows-Linux bridge behavior
- SSH key distribution more complex in mixed Windows/Linux environment
- Case sensitivity critical in cross-platform scripting

### Automation Prerequisites
- Manual host preparation still required before full automation
- Network connectivity must be established before configuration management
- User account consistency important for playbook reliability

### Tool Integration Challenges
- 1Password CLI requires desktop app integration for usability
- Ansible inventory requires precise IP and user configuration
- Tailscale simplifies networking but requires manual device authorization

## Future Enhancement Pipeline
1. Week 3: NAS integration for local backups
2. Month 2: Vault implementation for secret rotation
3. Month 3: Kubernetes migration for container orchestration
4. Ongoing: Cost optimization and monitoring refinement

## Success Metrics Achieved
- Three-host mesh network operational
- Passwordless SSH access established
- Ansible automation functional across all hosts
- Docker containerization ready for deployment
- CI/CD pipeline framework prepared
- Zero-cost monitoring solution implemented

## Final Status
Infrastructure setup completed successfully. All hosts configured and ready for application deployment and CI/CD pipeline activation.
